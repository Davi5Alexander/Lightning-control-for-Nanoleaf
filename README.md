# Unofficial lightning control for Nanoleaf

## Idea
You can use this software to control your *Nanoleaf* lights in a more convenient way.

So you might ask, why just don't use the official *Nanoleaf* app for mobile or desktop? 
Well, I don't really like the app. I'm not a big fan of the concept that you are limited to the relatively low maximum amount of effects that can be stored locally on a device.

And for **each** effect you have to...
1. choose one color palette
2. select one effect
3. predefine the respective, optional effect parameters
4. And last but not least: to save the specific effect with a name

This process takes a lot of time, and you are not able to perform quick adjustments for an effect.

---

I have a completely different approach to control the *Nanoleafs*. My idea is to create the effects *live*, *on-the-go*, for that I take advantage of the [Nanoleaf Devices OpenAPI](https://forum.nanoleaf.me/docs) function to display effects temporary on the Panels without saving it as an Effect. 

In the user interface (powered by Nicegui) you have the agony of choice about 1000 popular color palettes. Besides that you have an edit palette where you can adjust the colors and rearrange the order of the colors. You have also access to every Effect including their respective effect options.

## Setup guide
> ### Hints
> - When you are using the command line make sure that you are in the correct directory (change directory with `cd <dir>`)
> - The client which runs the app has to be in the same network as the Nanoleafs

### I. Installation
#### 1. Install Python
Get it from the [official homepage](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### 2. Download the repository
*manually*

or with

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/RobinSchfr/Lightning-control-for-Nanoleaf.git
```

#### 3. Install all dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### II. Device setup
#### 1. Get the IP address of your device
```bash
python tools/findNewDevice.py
```
If this script does not work, you have to look up manually in your router interface.

#### 2. Create a new authentication token for your device
```bash
python tools/createAuthToken.py
```

#### 3. Rename the file `.env.template` to `.env` and update the placeholders with the actual values

### III. Usage
#### 1. Launch the app
```bash
python src/main.py
```
The app is now available through http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser.

## Compatibility
The software especially the unit which creates the effects is only tested on *Nanoleaf Shapes*. 
It might not work properly on *Nanoleaf Lines*, *Nanoleaf Canvas* or *Nanoleaf Light Panels*.

## Roadmap
- [x] feature "create color Shades"
- [x] feature "add secondary color" to a palette
- [ ] Refactoring for better readability of the codebase
- [ ] embed the tools into the ui
- [ ] create executable with pyInstaller (first beta release)
- [ ] option to save color palettes
- [ ] shortcuts for color + effect combinations
- [ ] schedule: change palette/effect automatically after specific amount of time
- [ ] create lightshows (collection of effects â†’ next effect on a specific timestamp of a song)
- [ ] philips hue integration
- [ ] add more languages for the ui
